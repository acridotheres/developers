## About the ZIP format

The ZIP format is unarguably the most popular archive format in the world. It is used to compress and archive one or more files into a single file,
reducing the overall size and making it easier to transport or store. ZIP files can be password-protected and encrypted,
making them a secure way to transfer files. ZIP was created by Phil Katz &dagger; in 1989 and is now maintained by his own company, PKWARE, Inc.
